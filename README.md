This is a way to play Sticks in the CLI against a fairly simplistic AI model.

The goal of Sticks is to be the last player with hands still in the game. You lose by getting 5 fingers on both of your hands. 
Players tap an opponents hand with either of their hands and add up their fingers to the opponents. 
If the numbers add up to exactly five, the opponents hand is out.

Another move the player can do is split. If you have one hand that is out and one hand that is even, you can split your hand into exactly two sets of half the number. 

Have fun!
